Features to add:
-Formula for rating elevation

Bugs:
-When map is idle, it resets.  Causes old directions and charts to continue showing. (need to find a way to clear these when map becomes idle)
-Safari Browser (mobile and desktop) causes api calls to repeat countless times.  Causes errors with elevation charts showing multiple times each (4+).  And Over Query Limit from the API.
